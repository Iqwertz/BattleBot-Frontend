The editor:

Terminals: Each terminal is a drop zone, where you can drop instructions from the commands container. There are four terminals:
		* default - The instructions in here will be executed every time no callback is made. This terminal is looped (when the instructions are finished it starts from the beginning)
    * onOwnTrackDetected - This callback is called every time the bot detects his own track around him
    * onTrackDetected - This callback is called every time the bot detects an enemy track around him
    * onWallDetected - This callback is called every time the bot detects an obstacle around him

more about callbacks:
    * a callback is executed once per step. When the code reaches an "forward" instructions it returns, When one callback is executed no other will be. They are sorted in this priority: 1. onWallDetected, 2. onTrackDetected, 3. onOwnTrackDetected

bot-radar:
    * the bot radar is the visualsystem of the bot. Before every step the radar checks the tiles beside him and in front and saves these values in variables.
    * the variables are booleans
    * these are all availabel variables
